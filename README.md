# Language-detection-nlp
This project is my own academic project for NLP (Natural language Processing).
We get a dataset from online sources and do some data cleaning and pre processing on the dataset.
After that we use Naive Bayes and vectoriser machine learning model to detect the language 
This model can detect more than 80 languages.
